# Cyberpatriots Scoring Engine

A cyberpatriots scoring engine library.
This library aims to make it simple to make scoring engines for custom Cyberpatriots practice images.
I made this primarily for myself, however if other people can use it for their own purposes, good for them.
It was written to be as simple as possible, for better or for worse.

## TODOs:

- [ ] Implement more of `util`, specifically more filesystem functions
- [ ] Add an optional, more functional style for the engine.
- [ ] Testing, testing, and believe it or not, more testing
